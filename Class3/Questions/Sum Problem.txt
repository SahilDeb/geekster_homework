Write a do-while loop that asks the user to enter two numbers. 
The numbers should be added and the sum displayed. The loop should 
ask the user whether he or she wishes to perform the operation again
(for asking input to repeat the process 0 means termionate and 1 means perform again) . 
If so, the loop should repeat; otherwise it should terminate.


Input : 10 -10 0
Ouput : 0

Input : 100 50 1
output : 150
20 10 0
output : 30
